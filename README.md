# capsule
> Service for Storing And Interacting with Secrets (particularly Keys or MPC Shares) Off Blockchain

The goal of this library is to allow developers of OpenMined to simulate participating in a network where others have access to secret information that developers do not. In the trivial case, Capsule can generate a private Encryption key and never reveal it to the developer. See the [notebooks](./notebooks) folder for tutorials on how to use the library. 

## Setup

```sh build_and_run_zmq.sh
```
